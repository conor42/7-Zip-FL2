 *  Streaming compression
 *
 *  A FL2_CStream object is required to track streaming operation.
 *  Use FL2_createCStream() and FL2_freeCStream() to create/release resources.
 *  FL2_CStream objects can be reused multiple times on consecutive compression operations.
 *  It is recommended to re-use FL2_CStream in situations where many streaming operations will be done
 *  consecutively, since it will reduce allocation and initialization time.
 *
 *  Call FL2_createCStreamMt() with a nonzero dualBuffer parameter to use two input dictionary buffers.
 *  The stream will not block on FL2_compressStream(), and continue to accept data while compression is
 *  underway, until both buffers are full. Useful when I/O is slow.
 *  To compress with a single thread and use dual buffering, call FL2_createCStreamMt with nbThreads=1.
 *
 *  Use FL2_initCStream() on the FL2_CStream object to start a new compression operation.
 *
 *  Use FL2_compressStream() repetitively to consume input stream.
 *  The function will automatically update the `pos` field.
 *  It will always consume the entire input unless an error occurs or the dictionary buffer is filled,
 *  unlike the decompression function.
 *  @return : Nonzero if the CStream can accept more input,
 *            zero if compressed output must be copied (output is full or NULL),
 *            or an error code, which can be tested using FL2_isError().
 *
 *  The radix match finder allows compressed data to be stored in its match table during encoding.
 *  Applications may pass NULL instead of an FL2_outBuffer object pointer. In this case,
 *  when FL2_compressStream returns zero, the compressed data must be read from the internal buffers.
 *  Call FL2_getNextCStreamBuffer() repeatedly until it returns zero.
 *  Each call returns buffer information in the FL2_inBuffer parameter. Applications typically will 
 *  passed this to an I/O write function or downstream filter.
 *  Alternately, applications may pass an FL2_outBuffer object pointer to receive the output. In this case
 *  the return value can be ignored.
 *
 *  At any moment, it's possible, but not recommended, to compress whatever data remains
 *  within internal buffers using FL2_flushStream(). It may be necessary to call it twice if the
 *  CStream was created with dual dictionary buffers.
 *  Note 1 : this will reduce compression ratio because the algorithm is block-based.
 *  Note 2 : all compressed content must be read from the CStream object after each call before
             further flushing can occur.
 *  @return : 1 if data still present within internal buffers
              0 if they're empty
 *            or an error code, which can be tested using FL2_isError().
 *
 *  FL2_endStream() instructs to finish a stream.
 *  It will perform a flush and write the LZMA2 termination byte (required).
 *  FL2_endStream() may not be able to flush full data if the CStream was created with dual dictionary
 *  buffers or the output fills up. In which case, empty the output, or read all compressed data from
 *  the CStream if output == NULL, and call again FL2_endStream().
 *  @return : 0 if stream fully completed and flushed,
 *            or >0 to indicate bytes are still present within the internal buffers,
 *            or an error code, which can be tested using FL2_isError().
